This project aims to be my personal website and also an interactive portfolio that shows my Curriculum Vitae and comprehensive details about relevant projects I have been working on my academic and professional career in order to have a proof of my knowledge and skills.

## 🔭 Overview

This website not only will show general information about myself and my personal life, but also who I am professionally and academically, so I can show to other people what I have done in my career in a professional but more importantly in a fun way. Additionally, it will include a way to contact me and download my curriculum.

The whole project is broken down in three parts: front-end, back-end and infrastructure. This repository will contain the front-end and back-end together, while the infrastructure will be managed using Terraform in my other personal project repository [Lorentz][lorentz].

### ☑️ Requirements
There will be two main mandatory non-functional requirements in the development of this project:

1. The first and most important one is **get fun and enjoy**. As software engineer I want and need to show my passion and enjoyment for the technology. So, this website should speak itself about that.
2. Any hard skill or technology mentioned in my curriculum should be exemplified either on the website or within this project development in some way. This is in order to prove I actually have that hard skill or knowledge about that technology.

Other functional and non-functional requirements are detailed on following subsections.

#### 📃 Show my curriculum

#### 🤓 Show my personal life

#### 📧 Contact me by e-mail

#### ⬇️ Download my curriculum

#### 📱 Responsive website

### 🤔 Assumptions
